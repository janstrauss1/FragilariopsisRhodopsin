# Data for "_Plastid-localized xanthorhodopsin increases diatom biomass and ecosystem productivity in iron-limited surface oceans_"
The repository contains supplementary data and metadata used in the _Nature Microbiology_ research paper [Plastid-localized xanthorhodopsin increases diatom biomass and ecosystem productivity in iron-limited surface oceans](https://www.nature.com/nmicrobiol/).

## Phylogenetic tree of eukaryotic xanthorhodopsins
Rhodopsin sequences focusing on eukaryotic xanthorhodopsin protein sequences were collected from the scientific literature and supplemented with manually curated sequences from BlastP search results of the FcR1 protein sequence (UniProt: A0A1E7EXA4) against NCBI databases, a custom database from [Beja Lab](https://github.com/BejaLab), as well as similar sequences at an amino acid sequence identity threshold of â‰¥50% based on their membership in the UniRef50 cluster built using FcR1 as seed sequence (UniRef50_A0A7S2RIV1). The selected set of proteins was further supplemented with a manually curated set of outgroup sequences including characterized members of the proteorhodopsin subfamily totalling 242 sequences.

Sequences were aligned using [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) with default parameters and positions with 25% or more gaps were masked. The maximum-likelihood (ML) reference reconstruction was built using [RAxML v.8.277](https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML) under the LG+G4 model (selected using [IQ-TREE](https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE) with the corrected Akaike information criterion).

## AlphaFold2 3D structure prediction of Fragilariopsis cylindrus rhodopsin 1 (FcR1)
A predicted (3D) structure of FcR1 was generated using [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold). The [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](http://rcsb.org) was scanned for homologous structures using a [Dali search](http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali). The experimental structure of [PDB entry 4HYJ](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb4HYJ/pdb), a top five search hit was manually chosen based on highest quality according to PDB indicators and used for structural alignment with FcR1 using [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) to position the retinal in the predicted FcR1 structure. The final FcR1 model was generated by removing the structure of PDB ID 4HYJ and visualized using [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/).
